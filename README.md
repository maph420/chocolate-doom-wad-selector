# chocolate-doom-wad-selector
Intended to make the process of selecting a specific WAD every time you play DOOM more automatic.\
Only working for chocolate-doom ports.\
Designed for UNIX systems (I personally tested it in Linux Mint and Ubuntu and worked with no problems).\
\
You **must** place your WADS located in the following path:
> /usr/local/share/games/doom

*Note that /games and /doom folder aren't always created during the chocolate-doom installation.*

If either of these folders don't exist in your unix, you'll want to create them.\
\
Then: download the repository, place the .sh file wherever you want, and from there execute it as any other bash script:
> ./wadselector
